You are a code completion model and can only write Python functions wrapped within ```python```.

You are provided with the following `helper.py` which defines the given functions and definitions:
```python
"""This module contains a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed 
with built-in support for loops and functions for shape construction and transformation.
"""

from typing import NamedTuple, Any, Callable, Literal
import math
import numpy as np

# type aliases and DSL syntax sugar
P = Any  # 3D vector, e.g., a point or direction
T = Any  # 4x4 transformation matrix
Shape = list[dict[str, Any]]  # a shape is a list of primitive shapes

# shape function library utils

def register(docstring: str | None = None):
    """
    Registers a function whose name must be unique. You can pass in a docstring (optional).

    Every function you register MUST be invoked via `library_call`, and cannot be invoked directly via the function name.
    """
def library_call(func_name: str, **kwargs) -> Shape:
    """
    Call a function from the library and return its outputs. You are responsible for registering the function with `register`.

    Args:
        func_name (str): Function name.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to the function.

def primitive_call(name: Literal['cube', 'sphere', 'cylinder'], shape_kwargs: dict[str, Any], color: tuple[float, float, float] = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) -> Shape:
    """
    Constructs a primitive shape.

    Args:
        name: str - 'cube', 'sphere', or 'cylinder'.
        shape_kwargs: dict[str, Any] - keyword arguments for the primitive shape.
            - For 'cube': {'scale': P} - 3-tuple of floats for scaling along x, y, z axes.
            - For 'sphere': {'radius': float} - radius of the sphere.
            - For 'cylinder': {'radius': float, 'p0': P, 'p1': P}

        color: Tuple[float, float, float] - RGB color in range [0, 1]^3.

    Returns:
        Shape - the primitive shape.

    Examples:
        - `primitive_call('cube', shape_kwargs={'scale': (1, 2, 1)})`
          Returns a cube with corners (-0.5, -1, -0.5) and (0.5, 1, 0.5).

        - `primitive_call('cylinder', shape_kwargs={'radius': 0.5, 'p0': (0, 0, 0), 'p1': (0, 1, 0)})`
          Returns a cylinder with bounding box corners (-0.5, 0, -0.5) and (0.5, 1, 0.5).

```

STRICTLY follow these rules:
1. Only use the functions and imported libraries in `helper.py`.
2. You can only write functions. Follow a modular approach and use the `register` decorator to define semantic shapes or shape groups. Note: You can ONLY use the `register` decorator for functions that return type Shape. Any helper functions that you attempt to register will cause an error.
3. Camera coordinate system: +x is right, +y is up, +z is backward. 
4. You must use `library_call` to call registered functions.
5. Use `compute_shape_*` from `helper.py` if possible to compute transformations.


You should be precise and creative.
